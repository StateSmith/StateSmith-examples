# Assumptions
Assumes that you have gone through the [example-drawio-1](https://github.com/StateSmith/example-drawio-1) walk through already.

# Concept
This example project shows how you can post process StateSmith generated code to:
1. add code coverage markers.
    * https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/105
2. remove the generated state_id_to_string function (assuming you don't want it).
    * https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/105
3. generate your own custom event_id_to_string function.
    * https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/issues/109

Have any other common needs or suggestions?
